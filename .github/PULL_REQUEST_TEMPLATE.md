### Checklist

:white_check_mark: Please make sure you've done the following:

- [ ] Updated the current deployment header with the new apps, versions, commit hashes, addresses, Github links, and etc. on whichever networks the deployment happened
- [ ] Added a section to the deployment history with details about the new deployment
    - If you had to deploy more than once, please state the reason (e.g. old content URIs were pushed)
- [ ] Outside of the version tag, all links should be to a specific commit hash on its tree (e.g. `github.com/aragon/<repo>/tree/<commit hash>/...` and not `<repo>/commit/<commit hash>/...` or `<repo>/tree/<tag>/...`)
- [ ] **For deployments with content URIs**: made sure to download and add the IPFS back up
